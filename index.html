        <h2>Favorite Song and Its Lyrics</h2>
        <p>Currently obsessed with 'Jelly' by Irene and Seulgi! This irresistible track is part of their album 'Monster'. My favorite lyric line, 'Just wanting to have my day full of you, without any space left, what is this feeling?' perfectly captures the essence of the song's dreamy and enchanting vibes. </p>
